# 👋 Hi, I'm Saran Lakshman  

## 🚀 About Me  
I am passionate about **AI, Machine Learning, and Software Development**.  
I love building real-world projects that solve problems for students, farmers, drivers, and people with accessibility needs.  

Currently, I’m exploring **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and integrating it with LLMs to build intelligent assistants.

## 🔥 My Key Projects  
- 🌾 **Farmer Assistant Chatbot** – Predicts plant diseases and answers agricultural queries.  
- 🎓 **AI Tutor for Blind Students** – Supports PDF uploads, voice input, and session-based learning.  
- 🚘 **Driver Fatigue Detection Chatbot** – Engages in conversations to keep drivers alert.  
- ❤️ **Blood Request Manager** – Manages donor data and sends WhatsApp notifications for matching blood requests.  
- 🛡️ **Project Drishti** – AI-powered situational awareness platform for large events using Google AI tools.
